# Tilt-Angle-using-MPU-sensor-and-Blynk-App
This project helps us to find the angles of the three axes in 3D plane, i.e the X, Y and Z axes. The blynk app has been connected to the Arduino software and thus we obtain the same angles as otained on the serial monitor of the Arduino software, in an interactive view on the blynk mobile application screen as well. The main components used here are the NodeMCU and the MPU sensor.
